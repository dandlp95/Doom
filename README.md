# Doom

# Overview

This game is supposed to  be a 2D recreation of the iconic 1993 game, Doom. The player will control our main character, the Doomguy. In this very simple game, you will need to defeat the 1 daemon that shows in the screen. The daemon will move side to side, shooting balls of fire. You can move side to side and jump with the side and up arrow keys. You can also use the space bar to shoot. You can keep track of your health with the face on  the top left corner. The more injure the face looks, the less health you have left. The game will be over once you defeat the deamon or it defeats you. 

I created this project to start game development. I chose pygame to gain some exposure to some of the basic concepts of game development such as display graphics and move objects based on user input. I will continue  to work in this game to gain more experience, but my main purpose will be to build something more complex in Unreal Engine.
